All my dotfiles.

I use bash, tmux, git and vim heavily - the legacy programmer mode

This repo contains all the settings I need - in one shot - to configure my environments

## Setup

A simple one

```
git clone git@github.com/shreyasrk/dotfiles.git # Ensure you can clone over ssh (preferred)
cd dotfiles/
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh # Ensure you have bash installed and can access github.com (check proxies/firewall settings if necessary)
```

That's it! Feel free to raise PR in case you find anything missing (or better ones!)

### Note

This repo will undergo changes, albeit no-so-frequently - please raise a PR for me to get an email to review it!
